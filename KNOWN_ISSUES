We currently have the following known issues. They are all considered of low
importance, and while we intend to fix them we make no promises about when.

* When testing a zone using GOST-family algorithms in DNSSEC and having an
  underlying OpenSSL library without GOST support, the Zonemaster DNSSEC test
  results may be misleading or unpredictable. The Net::LDNS module will warn at
  build time if OpenSSL lacks GOST support.
  
* Testing alternative root zones is not possible. Testing the usual root zone
  is possible, but not all results make sense.
